## Youtube Clone web app

A YouTube clone app is a platform designed to emulate the popular video-sharing and streaming service, YouTube. It typically includes core features such as video searching and video viewing. Let's explore these features in more detail:

### Video Search Functionality:
- Search Bar: The app should have a search bar prominently displayed at the top, allowing users to enter keywords, video titles, or channel names to find relevant content.
- Search Algorithms: To deliver relevant results, the app typically employs complex search algorithms that consider factors like video titles, descriptions, tags, view counts, and user engagement metrics.

### Video Viewing Features:

- Video Player: Each video in the app should have a dedicated video player, allowing users to watch content seamlessly. This player should include standard controls like play/pause, volume control, and full-screen mode.
- Quality Options: Users may be able to select video quality to suit their internet connection and device capabilities, such as 1080p, 720p, or lower resolutions.
- Video Recommendations: YouTube clone apps often use recommendation algorithms to suggest related videos to users, keeping them engaged and on the platform.
